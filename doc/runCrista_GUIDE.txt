runCrista is a program designed to run large instances of L1-penalized logistic and linear regression on MPI enabled clusters.  There are a few features that make this program attractive to users:
- Solves on a path of regularization weights, starting with a large weight and gradually decreasing to the desired final weight.  This tactic often increases accuracy of the final solution and decreases the number of iterations.
- Uses the CBLAS library for efficient linear algebra operations.
- Capable of handling very large, non-sparse problem instances.
- Reads in and outputs plain text files.  This is a negative for performance, but we hope increases usability.
- Has a companion program, runCrossValidatedCrista, that runs cross validation to determine the best regularization weight for prediction.

1. Compiling

After modifying the Makefile to properly link a CBLAS library, runCrista.c can be compiled by simply running 'make' from the command line.

2. Setting options to runClistaSolve

The options are contained in the text files 'parameters/masterParameters.txt' and 'parameters/slaveParameters.txt'.  The slave parameters are as follows:

MatrixFileName -> string argument pointing to the file containing the 'A' matrix
numRows -> each slave attempts to read in a matrix with this many rows
numCols -> each slave attempts to read in a matrix with this many cols 
           (THIS SHOULD MATCH numCols from the master parameters!)
interceptFlag -> '1' if we want to add an extra column of ones to the A matrix 
                 to represent the intercept. '0' otherwise

REMARK: It is okay if each slave cannot find enough rows to fill their A matrix.  For example, suppose the data file contains a 100 x 100 matrix and we would like to use 3 slaves.  If we put numRows = 34, then the first and second slaves will perform computations with a 34 x 100 matrix and the last slave will use a 32 x 100 matrix comprised of the last 32 rows of matrix A.

The master parameters are as follows:

FileNameForX0 -> 'zeros' if we want x_initial to be the all zeros vector.  Otherwise, 
                 string pointing to a file containing an appropriate x_initial vector.
FileNameForB -> string argument pointing to the file containing the 'b' vector
OutputFile -> output of the program is written to this file
numCols -> right dimension of the matrix 'A' (MUST MATCH SLAVE'S numCols!)
numLambdas -> The code solves on a path of lambdas ending at the smallest lambda value.
              This argument determines how many lambdas to include in the path.
lambdaStart -> largest value of lambda.  Enter a negative value to force automatic 
               calculation of the largest lambda.
lambdaFinish -> smallest value of lambda.
StepSizeDecretion -> How much to decrease the stepsize after a failed backtracking iteration.
                     0.9 is standard.
InitialStep -> Size of initial gradient step.
RegressionType -> 'l' for linear regression. 'o' for logistic regression.
FistaAcceleration -> '1' to use FISTA style accelerated search point.  '0' to use basic ISTA search point.
MaximumIterations -> maximum number of iterations spent optimizing at a particular lambda.
MinimumFuncDelta -> optimization stops if percent change in objective is less than this value.

3. Running in MPI

To submit the code to the SunGridEngine cluster scheduler one needs to use a wrapper script similar to 'GridEngineMpiWrapperScript'.  With this wrapper, submission looks like:

$ qsub GridEngineMpiWrapperScript 5 runCrista parameters/masterParameters.txt parameters/slaveParameters.txt

Remember that the number of slaves is the number of processes minus one.  So the above call would run the code with 4 slaves.

4. Output

The code will print the calculated intercept and x_vector to the file defined by OutputFile.  The code prints to the screen data about the number of iterations and the objective function decrease.  In SGE, this will be sent to a file 'RUNmpiPROGRAM.oJOBID'.
